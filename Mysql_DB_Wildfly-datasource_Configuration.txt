############################################# Jboss Datasource Configuration ################################################ 
Min Connection: 100
Max Connection: 1000  

# Connection Formula: 
app_instance_datasource_Max_conection  = (max_connection_Database/app_instance_count) + (max_connection_Database/2*app_instance_count)

- Configure Connection Validation Configuration on Connection borrow or release or background check for Connection Validity

idle-timeout-minutes: 30    
query-timeout: 100 	  
blocking-timeout-millis: 60000
set-tx-query-timeout: true
use-try-lock: 100
allocation-retry: 2
allocation-retry-wait-millis: 6000

- Query timeout(idle timeout/10 ~ 20) < Background Validation Time (idle timeout/2) < idle timeout <  Database wait_timeout  

### Database Configuration ###
max_connections = 5000
wait_timeout=6000   # By Default 8 Hours => This Need to set Max if No Connection leaks in Application to achieve optimal performance by reusing the same connection    
interactive_timeout=600 
connect_timeout=5

innodb_io_capacity and innodb_io_capacity_max  [These Parameter's to set when performing a lot of writes all the time ]
innodb_io_capacity_max=6000   [If SSD Available]
innodb_io_capacity=3000  (50% of the max)

# No of I/O threads for read and write operations
innodb_read_io_threads = 16
innodb_write_io_threads = 4

# Example
If wait_timeout is 1800 (30 Minutes), the DB Connection will close in 30 minutes if the connection is idle (indicated by Sleep in the command column of the processlist).
If connect_timeout is 10, then mysqld will reject you if you cannot login (authenticate) in 10 seconds.

### Key Terminology
- Interactive SQL: SQL statements input from terminal; DBMS outputs to screen.
- Non-interactive SQL: SQL statements are included in an application program written in a host language, like C, Java, COBOL.

- interactive_timeout: wait Timeout for interactive session, The number of seconds the server waits for activity on an interactive connection before closing it.
- wait_timeout : wait Timeout for non-interactive session, The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a noninteractive connection before closing it.
- connect_timeout : The number of seconds that the mysqld server waits for a connect packet before responding with Bad handshake. max time can be use just to make connection.


### Hibernate Configuration ###

<property name="hibernate.connection.release_mode">auto</property> 
<property name="hibernate.connection.autocommit">true</property>

<property name="hibernate.connection.is-connection-validation-required">true</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.isolation">1</property>
